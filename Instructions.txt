# Assignment 9 - Due Friday 22 November 2013
#
# Introduction to OpenFOAM:  parallel computing
#
# 1. The purpose of this assignment is to conduct a parallel scaling-study for the simpleFoam solver 
#    using the pitzDaily tutorial.   To complete this assignment you need to do the following,
# 
#     A.  run the baseline pitzDaily tutorial (12225 hexahedral cells) on 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, 64-processors.
#
#     B.  modify the blockMeshDict so that you have a mesh of approximately 500,000 cells.   Redo the scaling study.
#
#     C.  modify the blockMeshDict so that you have a mesh of approximately 5,000,000 cells.   Redo the scaling study.
#
#
#  What to hand in:
#
# 1.  A text-file "report" which documents your work.   Your report should include the following elements,
#
#     A.   Documentation of your modifications to the meshes.   A plot showing average number of cells-per-processor
#          for each decomposition.
#
#     B.   A plot of cellDist for your fine mesh for each of the decompositions.
#
#     C.   Plots of parallel efficiency vs. number of processors
#
#     D.   Study your log file and answer the question:   does domain decomposition impact the convegence
#          of the linear solver for the pressure equation?   Can you make a plot which shows this?
#
#     E.   Short discussion on your observations.

#   SUGGESTION
#------------------------
#
#   To conduct a scaling study, you need to extract information from the log file on wall-clock time.   Be careful
#   to exclude I/O from this.   For example, since the writeInterval in system/controlDict is set to 50, only use
#   the wall-clock-time for time-step 1 to 40.   This will eliminate I/O and give a scaling based solely on solution
#   of the Navier-Stokes equations.    Bonus question:   what happens to your scaling if you include wall-clock-time
#   for the entire simulation, including I/O?    What happens if you change the writeInterval to 5?
