# Assignment 8 - Due Friday 8 November 2013
#
# Introduction to OpenFOAM:  set-up and tutorials
#
# 1. load the OpenFOAM environment on BlueRidge using the OpenFOAM module
#
# 2. modify your .bashrc so that it is automatically loaded upon login
#
# 3. verify that the OpenFOAM installation is functional
#
# 4. identify the environment variables which are set by the OpenFOAM environment.  Based on these
#    variables, identify:  which C++ compiler was used, was OpenFOAM compiled as single- or
#    double-precision, which MPI library is OpenFOAM linked to?
#
# 5. identify important OpenFOAM linux aliases.  Hint:  look in $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/config/ 
#
# 6. copy the tutorials in $FOAM_TUTORIALS to your $WORK directory
#
# 7. run the backward-facing-step tutorial, $WORK/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/pitzDaily.  
#
# 8. run a tutorial of your choice.   
#
#
#  What to hand in:
#
# 1.  A text-file "report" which documents output from parts 2, 3, 4, 5. 
#
# 2.  Plot the solution residuals from part 7 to document convergence.   Make an 
#     image of the velocity field using ParaView.
#
# 3.  Communicate the results from part 8 using a plot and a visualization.  Make sure to 
#     identify the solver and case that you studied.
