# Scalability of ScaLAPACK - Part II
#
#
# 1) Carry out a strong scaling study by varying the process grid for a
#    LU factorization of a matrix of fixed size. The size of the matrix
#    the size of the blocks, 
#
#  NOTE: Increase the memory available to the code by increasing the 
#        parameter 'TOTMEM' in the file 'pdludriver.f' located in the
#	 directory ScaLAPACK/TESTS/LIN
#
#	 You will need to re-compile ScaLAPACK for this change to have
#	 an effect.
#
#
# 2) Run a single parallel simulation to measure the maximum performance 
#    (reported in MFLOPS) that you can achieve using 16 blueridge nodes.
#
#
# What to hand in:
#
#	1) Runscripts and output files (.oXXXXXX) showing your performance measurements
#	2) Input files for each case (i.e. 'LU.dat') --  rename the input files 
#	   in descriptive way for each case, such as:
#	   
#         cp LU.dat LU.dat.strongscale
#         cp LU.dat LU.dat.performance
